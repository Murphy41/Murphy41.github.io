I recently returned from IROS 2025 in Hangzhou, where I had the opportunity to share my latest updates at the **Augmentative Human-Robot Interaction: From Human Augmentation to Human-Inspired Collaboration** workshop.

It was a fantastic experience to present our paper, **"Motor Cost Compromise in Human Movement Pattern Shaping,"** through both an oral presentation and a poster session. This work serves as an extension of our research previously published in **[IEEE TNSRE](https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSRE.2021.3096516)**, pushing those concepts further. Engaging with experts in the field provided invaluable feedback that I am already incorporating into the next iteration of this project.

Beyond the academic tracks, the industry expo was a major highlight. Seeing the sheer scale of commercial robotics and the latest hardware deployments on the floor was truly amazing. It was also a pleasure to share this experience with my lab mate Mr. Zheyu Liu and Dr. Jonathan Eden—it’s always special to represent our research group together.

On a personal note, I actually kickstarted the trip with a brief stop in **Shanghai**, **Suzhou**, and **Nanjing** before heading to Hangzhou. It was the perfect way to recharge and enjoy some city views before diving into the busy conference week.
