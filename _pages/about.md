Hi, I am **Yangmengfei (Murphy) Xu 徐杨梦飞**, a PhD student in the Human Robotics Lab at the University of Melbourne, advised by Prof. Denny Oetomo and Prof. Ying Tan.

My research interests lie at the intersection of **Robotics, Control Systems, Human-Robot Interaction and Human-Centered AI**. I aim to develop intelligent autonomous systems that can robustly operate in real-world environments and intuitively collaborate with humans. My research spans learning-based control, advanced sensing, intelligent hardware, and human-aware reasoning.
